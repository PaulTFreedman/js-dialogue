# Introduction
This is a project I undertook to try to make something fun that would simultaneously give me a chance to practice my JavaScript. It seeks to approximate the dialogue boxes that you see in many old and contemporay video games, particularly Zelda.

# Usage
There is a text-box at the bottom of the page that allows the user to input text, which will subsequently be displayed in the dialogue box above. Instructions for how to achieve specific paging behaviours are given in the default text. Clicking on the dialogue box will advance the text if the current page has finished, or skip to the end of the page otherwise.

# Acknowledgements
The font used in this project came from user codeman38 (http://www.zeldalegends.net/?n=fonts).

#To-Dos
- Enable Enter press to advance text
- Set max character count in a more dynamic way, to account for varying screen sizes
